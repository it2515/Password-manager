# About 
This program makes use of tkinter to create a user interface that you can interact with. 
The program is desinged to help you manage your online account information.
The project also incorporates a random password generator to help you create a secure password.
I enjoyed working on this project and will be back soon to clean and update it.


The layout of this program is relatively simple everything has been put into functions so it shouldn't be too difficult to figure out.


The program uses sqlite to store all of your infromation on your PC.
There's two different databases in this program, one database stores the login information and the other stores each users information on diffrent tables. 
The sqlite uses the variable 'name' to create a table for each user that logs in
.Each table will automatically be created for you.

updates will becoming soon on this project, however I first want to get started with my other projects before I finish updating this program.
updates will include a more aesthetic layout with images, update and delete function and the ability to select the length of your password you want to generate.

If there is any qustions about this program feel free to message me.
